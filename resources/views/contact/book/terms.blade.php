## Bookings

1.  BTS try to accommodate all requests for the provision of their services but they are not obliged to do so in any circumstances. In particular their availability will be limited during exam times and they will often be unable to provide services on dates upon which they already have a booking.
2.  All requests for bookings must be placed online via the online booking form. Thereafter a provisional quote will be provided by BTS. This may be subject
to change.
3.  No contract shall be created unless and until BTS accepts the booking request and subsequently issue a booking confirmation via email, is issued by a
committee member, stating that the event is confirmed.

## Costs and Fees

4.  BTS are a non-profit making organisation. BTS will issue a production charge for each event depending upon what exactly is involved and the nature and extent of services required. There may also be other costs (see clause 5). In each case a quote will be given which will include the production charge and subsequently confirmed, subject to clause 2 above.
5.  The costs charged may include the following but this list is not intended to be exhaustive:
    *   the cost of all transport, (for the Crew and Equipment) to and from the venue to attend the Event
    *   the cost of the hire and insurance of any equipment hired by BTS for the Event, (although all arrangements will be made by BTS)
    *   the transport costs in attending any pre-event venue inspection if this is deemed necessary, (for example to assess its suitability, verify the size of a stage, check power supply etc)If a pre-event venue inspection takes place and it is determined that BTS cannot/will not provide their services, (for example because the venue is deemed unsuitable), BTS may recover the reasonable costs that they incurred in carrying out the pre-event venue inspection. This may either be by retaining any sum charged by them in advance in connection with the inspection or by subsequently raising an invoice to cover such costs. In the latter case the client shall be liable to pay the invoice within 30 days.
6.  In circumstances where transport for the Crew and/or Equipment to and from the Event is needed, BTS will try to arrange for a BTS Union vehicle driver to handle this. However if a BTS Union vehicle driver is not available then the Client will either need to arrange such transport, (e.g. by providing a Union Driver in the case of a Union event), or they will be charged for this as mentioned above, (if private transport is used this will normally be at the current Union rates.
7.  Late Bookings are those taken with less than 2 weeks notice. A late booking fee may be charged in such cases at BTS's discretion.
8.  BTS may require in its discretion that the total costs of providing its services are paid up front, (either in full or in part), either prior to an Event
taking place or at the time of the booking being taken.
9.  Subject to clause 8 above BTS will issue an invoice setting out the applicable fees. All invoices are payable on receipt and no later than 30 days after they are received by the Client, even if the Client has an arrangement with another person whereby payment is to be made by that person. BTS reserve the right to charge interest on invoices which are not paid within 30 days of dispatch from the date on which payment of their invoice was due, until the date of actual payment. The current rate of interest is 2% above the HSBC base rate.

## Cancellation of BTS' Services

10.  If a booking/event is cancelled by the client for whatever reason, all unrecoverable costs incurred will be paid by the Client and a further cancellation fee of up to 100% of the total fees payable may be charged to the Client at BTSâ€™s discretion.

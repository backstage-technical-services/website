<h3>Welcome to the training skills section</h3>
<p>The SU requires us to keep accurate records of the membership's abilities, to ensure we're safe and following the relevant standards.
     These records are also used to plan training to ensure skills are retained within the membership.</p>
<p>Please note that current skills records and applications have moved and are no longer being managed from the website.
All available skills and their criteria can be viewed and applied for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xq3JVDMIE52_0iWZiymMsDvMINEfz0p0G0x2WdImSHo">here.</a>
 If you feel you are eligible for any skill, submit a request through this link and the Training & Safety Officer will review your application.</p>

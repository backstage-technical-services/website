<h3>Welcome to the training skills section</h3>
<p>It is required by the Students' Union that we keep accurate records of our membership's abilities so they will be confident that we know
    what we're doing and do it safely and to the relevant standards. We can also use these skills to help us plan any training to ensure
    that we retain the skills necessary to do what we do.</p>
<p>This section provides details on what skills are available, who has what and what you need to do be eligble for a skill. If you feel you
    should have a skill then you can use the 'Propose a Skill' function - this alerts the Training and Safety Officer, who will review your
    proposal.</p>
<p>If you are 'Level 3' in a skill then you are also allowed to award that skill to other members, using the 'Award skill' function.</p>

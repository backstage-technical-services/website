**These are for guidance and do not replace the elections procedure written within the Backstage constitution, which is the accurate version.**

Elections for the Backstage Committee will be held in the second semester, and will abide by Bath SU's society election dates, unless a clash with another Backstage event requires an exemption to be sought.

Any Backstage member who will be a full student member in the following year may stand for election to any one or more of the committee positions.

Any full student member may stand for more than one position.

## Nominations

- Nominations will take the form of manifestos submitted by candidates to the online election system on bathstudent.com.
- Members are encouraged to send their manifestos to the Backstage mailing list (backstage@lists.bath.ac.uk), once they have nominated themselves online.
- All manifestos will be published on the Backstage website, unless a candidate specifically requests otherwise.
- Published manifestos can be found on the Backstage website ([http://www.bts-crew.com](http://www.bts-crew.com)), as well as the online system at [bathstudent.com](http://www.bathstudent.com).

## Hustings

- Hustings will take place at the AGM, which will be held between nominations closing and voting opening. Candidates are encouraged, but not required to attend.
- A suitable impartial person will be nominated to chair the hustings. This may be the chair of the AGM, if they are not standing for election.
- Hustings will consist of a one minute speech by the candidate followed by a series of questions.
- The speech can take any form the candidate chooses, but traditionally it is to explain why the candidate is standing for that role and what they would do if they were elected.
- There shall be preselected questions by the chairperson, and then there will be questions from the floor at the discretion of the chairperson. The number of questions preselected and from the floor is to be decided by the chairperson.
- If more than one candidate is standing, each will be asked the same questions.
- The order of questioning will be decided by the chairperson and rotated during hustings.
- Questions may be suggested by contacting the chairperson prior to the AGM.
- Following questions will be at the discretion of the chairperson. The same questions will be put to all candidates for the same position. Following questions should be made immediately after the initial question.
- In the event that a candidate cannot attend the AGM, but wish to be represented, then they must advise the chairperson of this. The chairperson shall seek to obtain answers to the questions from them prior to the AGM. They will not be able to answer any following questions or make a speech, but may send a statement in to be read by a proxy of their choosing with the prior permission of the chairperson.

## Voting

- Voting will take place on bathstudent.com, as set out in Bath SU's elections procedures, for a period of time after hustings.
- Only full student members of Backstage are eligible to vote.
- If the outcome of the elections is that no candidate is selected for any of the positions, a by-election will be held within Bath SU's timetable (or within two teaching weeks, if not applicable).
- In the event of a tie for the elected position, a count back will be held between the tied members, to determine who received the highest number of first-choice votes. If the vote remains tied in first-choice votes, a coin will be tossed by Bath SU's Acting Returning Officer to determine the winner.
- In the event of a single candidate running for two (or more) positions, they will be contacted by Bath SU's Acting Returning Officer before voting, and asked which one they would prefer to take, in the event of them winning multiple positions. If they do win more than one election, they will be eliminated from the polls that were not their preference, and their votes will be redistributed.
- The winners of the ballots will be announced on bathstudent.com. The Chair, or other committee member if needed, should then circulate them around the Backstage mailing list, and the results will be declared on the Backstage website. The voting numbers or order of results will not be declared.

## Disputes

Disputes about the process or results of the election should be made to the Bath SU Acting Returning Officer, as set out in Bath SU's Election Rules.

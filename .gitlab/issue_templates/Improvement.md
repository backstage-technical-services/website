#### Improvement

Describe what your improvement is. Smaller improvements may just need a few sentences, but the bigger the request the more information we'll need to make it happen! Don't be afraid to write out any ideas you've already thought of, and take advantage of formatting and lists to make it easier to read!

#### Rationale

Why should this be implemented? How does this benefit members (or the committee)?

#### Urgency

How time sensitive is this? Low? Medium? High? Very High? If there's a date or event this needs to be done by, please enter that here too.
